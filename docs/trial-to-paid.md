Under "**Subscription Plan**", your "**Current plan**" should list "**Free Trial**". Click on "**Upgrade**" to upgrade your trial account to a paid subscription.

:::tip Account that owns the site is responsible for the billing
If you're using Plausible as [a part of a team](users-roles.md), note that the account that owns the site(s) in Plausible is also the account that needs to have an active subscription. Please upgrade to a subscription through the account that owns the site(s) or do [transfer the site ownership](transfer-ownership.md) to the account that you want to be responsible for the billing
:::

## Choose your subscription tier

Our subscription tiers are based on the total number of pageviews and custom events per month between all the sites you have added to your Plausible Analytics account. 

Check your current pageview and custom event usage in the "**Usage & Limits**" section of your account settings. There we list the total number of billable pageviews during your trial period to date.

Select a subscription tier that matches your billable pageviews. Opt for monthly or yearly billing. You can get 2 free months with an annual subscription.

Next, decide on your plan:

* Choose "**Growth**" for essential features, ideal for growing teams
* Go for "**Business**" for advanced features, multiple sites and larger teams
  
Then click on the "**Upgrade**" button to get started.

The billing information and the payment process is handled by Paddle, a third-party payment processor. Click on the "**Pay securely via Paddle**" button.

Choose your location and click on the "**Continue**" button.

## Add your company address and VAT number

On the "**Payment**" screen in the upgrade process, you have the option to add your company address and VAT ID. Our payment processor Paddle handles all the VAT and other sales taxes, so if you're eligible no VAT will be charged on your subscription.

Your subscription will start right away. Your subscription will be renewed automatically, and you can change or cancel your plan at any time.

You will automatically get an email from Paddle with your invoice. You will get an automatic invoice sent to you through email for each payment that you make. You can also [download your invoices](download-invoices.md) in your Plausible account settings.

If you haven't added your company details and VAT number during the subscription process, you can open the invoice that Paddle sent you and click on the "**Add address & VAT Number**" link to do so.

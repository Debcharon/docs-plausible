:::note
If you're using Plausible as [a part of a team](users-roles.md), note that the account that owns the site(s) in Plausible is also the account that needs to have an active subscription. Please upgrade to a subscription through the account that owns the site(s) or do [transfer the site ownership](transfer-ownership.md) to the account that you want to be responsible for the billing.

## Choose your subscription tier

Our pricing levels are based on the number of page views per month for all the sites you have added to your Plausible Analytics account combined. 

Check your current page view usage. We list the total number of page views between all the sites you have in your Plausible Analytics account during your trial period to date.

Choose your subscription tier according to the number of monthly page views and decide between monthly or yearly billing. You can get 2 months free if you subscribe to a yearly plan.

Click on the "**Pay securely via Paddle**" button. The payment process is handled by a third-party payment provider. The billing information and the payment process is handled by Paddle.

## Choose your payment method and subscribe

Choose your location and click on the "**Continue**" button.

Next up you need to choose your payment method. You can pay by a credit card, PayPal, Apple Pay or Google Pay.

Fill in your card details and click on the "**Subscribe Now**" button to subscribe to a paid subscription. 

## Add your company address and VAT number

On the "**Payment**" screen in the upgrade process, you have the option to add your company address and VAT ID. Our payment processor Paddle handles all the VAT and other sales taxes, so if you're eligible no VAT will be charged on your subscription.

Your subscription will start right away. Your subscription will be renewed automatically, and you can change or cancel your plan at any time.

You will automatically get an email from Paddle with your invoice. You will get an automatic invoice sent to you through email for each payment that you make. You can also [download your invoices](download-invoices.md) in your Plausible account settings.

If you haven't added your company details and VAT number during the subscription process, you can open the invoice that Paddle sent you and click on the "**Add address & VAT Number**" link to do so.

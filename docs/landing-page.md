When you log into your Plausible Analytics account, you are met with the ["**My Sites**" landing page](https://plausible.io/sites), where we list all the websites you have access to.

In the top right, you can access your account settings or log out of your account. We use [Gravatar](https://gravatar.com) to get your account profile picture. If your picture doesn't display, please add the email address associated with your Plausible account to your Gravatar profile. We use a proxy for this request to ensure your information is not exposed to Gravatar. This method prevents the IP address, user agent and referrer header from being sent.

Further down the "**My Sites**" page, you have the search box on the left so you can quickly find a site and the "**+ Add a website**" button on the right so you can [add a new site](add-website.md) to your account.

The rest of the "**My Sites**" page features all your sites. To give you a quick overview, we display the number of visitors in the last 24 hours next to each site. There's also a graph of each site for a quick overview of the traffic and a comparison to the previous period so you can see the trend. 

You can click on any website to enter [its stats dashboard](guided-tour.md) or you can click on the "**Settings**" icon on the right-hand side of the domain name to enter the [website settings section](website-settings.md).

There are a couple of keyboard shortcuts that you can use on the "**My Sites**" page. You can press `/` to start a search or press the `Esc` key to clear the search. For more shortcuts that you can use on the dashboard itself, take a look at [this list](keyboard-shortcuts.md).

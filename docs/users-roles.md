Plausible allows you to invite team members to view stats and manage sites that you have added to your Plausible account.

You can invite any email address. It doesn't necessarily need to be an email address from your company. You can invite existing Plausible users or people who don't have a Plausible account.

Our [private and secure shared links](shared-links.md) are a great way to share a particular dashboard quickly

## How to invite users

* Go into [the site settings](website-settings.md) of the website you'd like to invite users to
* Click on the "**People**" section on the left-hand sidebar
* Click on the "**Invite**" button
* Enter the email address of the person you'd like to invite. If you invite a new person to Plausible, they will need to register for a Plausible account with the exact email address that you invited
* Assign the role for the invited user. You can choose between two different roles:

1. "**Admin**" gets access to the stats dashboard, can change the site settings and invite other members
2. "**Viewer**" gets access to the stats dashboard

* Click on the "**Invite**" button. We will email the invited person to notify them about your invitation. They will need to register for a Plausible account with the email address that was invited (or log in to their existing Plausible account registered with that email address) and accept your invitation. All invitations expire after 48 hours

### Who's responsible for the billing?

Note that the owner of a site in Plausible is responsible for the billing of that site and needs to have an active paid subscription. All invited users (both Viewers and Admins) can use Plausible and view stats for sites they were invited to free of charge without having their own subscription.

If the invited user adds a brand new site to their Plausible account and becomes an owner of that site, then the trial comes into effect. They'll need to subscribe to a plan to continue viewing the stats of the site they own after the trial expires. As an alternative, they can transfer the ownership of a site they own to the account that has a paid subscription. That way they won't need a subscription themselves. [Take a look here](transfer-ownership.md).

## How to modify the user roles

You can change the user role at any time:

* Go into the site settings of the website you'd like to modify the roles for
* Click on the "**People**" section on the left-hand sidebar. That's where you can get an overview of the current team members and their existing roles
* Click on the current role next to the name of the person you'd like to change the role for
* Choose a new role for the user

That's it. The user now has a different role.

Note that you need to be an owner or an admin of a site to change user roles.

## How to remove a user

You can remove a user from having access to a site at any time:

* Go into the site settings of the website you'd like to remove a user for
* Click on the "**People**" section on the left-hand sidebar
* Click on the current role next to the name of the person you'd like to remove
* Click "**Remove member**" 

That's it. The user has now been removed from the specific site.

Note that you need to be an owner or an admin of a site to remove users.

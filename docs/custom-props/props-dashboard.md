## 1. Configure properties in your Site Settings

Before any properties will be visible in your dashboard, you have to explicitly configure them. In your [site settings](website-settings.md), navigate to the Properties section, where you can add and remove properties that are displayed on your dashboard.

You also have the option to enable all properties that you've already sent with one click.

## 2. Filter by a custom property

As soon as you have at least one event with a custom property, you will be able to see an option to filter by that property in your Plausible dashboard. To do that, open up the filter dropdown menu and select "**Property**".

<img alt="Custom Property Filter" src={useBaseUrl('img/custom-property-filter.png')} />

In that view you can interact with the dropdown fields, where Plausible will automatically provide filtering suggestions based on the custom properties for pageviews that we have recorded. The suggestions also take into account the selected time period and other filters already applied.

Choose the custom property that you want to analyze and click on "**Apply Filter**" to filter your dashboard. Note that you can only filter by one custom property at a time.

## 3. Break down your traffic by a custom property

At the bottom of your dashboard, you have the Behaviors section which allows you to switch to the "**Properties**" tab on the top right.

In this view, you can select a property to see the value breakdown for.

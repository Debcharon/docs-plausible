By default, Plausible Analytics tracks every visitor to your website. When you're working on your site, you might not want to record your own visits and page views. Here's how to block your page views from your Plausible Analytics stats dashboard.
 
:::tip Using WordPress?
You can use our [official WordPress plugin](https://plausible.io/wordpress-analytics-plugin) which excludes views coming from admins and other user roles
:::

## How to exclude your own visits from being counted

* Go into the [site settings](website-settings.md) of the website you'd like to block your activity from

* Click on the "**Shields**" section in the left-hand sidebar

* There you'll see a list of all the IP addresses that you're blocking at the moment

* Click on the "**Add IP Address**" button to add a new address to the block list

* You can manually insert an IP address or click to block your current IP address

* You can also add a description to help you identify which device or location you have blocked

* You can block up to 30 different IP addresses per website
  
* Once added to the block list, we will start blocking traffic from that specific IP address within a few minutes
  
## How to remove an IP address from the blocklist

* In the list of all the IP addresses that you're blocking currently, find the IP address you want to remove

* Click on the "**Remove**" button next to that IP address to remove it from the blocklist

By default, Plausible Analytics tracks every visitor to your website. When you're working on your site, you might not want to record your own visits and pageviews.

Here's how to block your pageviews from your Plausible Analytics stats dashboard.

You can use our [official WordPress plugin](https://plausible.io/wordpress-analytics-plugin) which excludes views coming from admins and other user roles

## How to exclude your own visits from being counted

* Go into the [site settings](website-settings.md) of the site you'd like to block yourself from.

* Click on the "**Shields**" section in the left-hand sidebar

* There's you'll see a list of all the IP addresses that you're blocking currently

* Click on the "**Add IP Address**" button to add a new address to the block list

* You can manually insert an IP address or click to block your current IP address

* You can also add any description to help you identify which device or location you have blocked

* You can block up to 30 different IP addresses per website
  
* Once added to the blocklist, we will start blocking traffic from that specific IP address within a few minutes
  
## How to remove an IP address from the blocklist

* Click on the "**Remove**" button next to that IP address to remove it from the blocklist

To integrate Plausible Analytics into your website, just insert a tracking snippet right into your website’s code with the help of the [Code editor](https://help.readymag.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020844171-Adding-custom-code). Please note that you can only add custom code on [paid plans](https://readymag.com/pricing), so you might need to upgrade your plan to integrate third-party tools.

Follow the instructions below to add Plausible tracking:

* Copy the tracking snippet in your Plausible profile.
* Open your website’s project settings, click the `Code tab`, and open the `Code editor`.
* Paste the tracking snippet into the `<HEAD>` section, then click `Save&Close`. The code will be applied to the entire website.
* Republish your website, then check your Plausible Analytics profile to make sure the stats are now being tracked.
